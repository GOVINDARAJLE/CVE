{"Source":"CVE FEED","Title":"CVE-2025-23131 - IBM DLM null pointer dereference vulnerability","Content":"CVE ID : CVE-2025-23131\nPublished : April 16, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 23 minutes ago\nDescription : In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndlm: prevent NPD when writing a positive value to event_done\n\ndo_uevent returns the value written to event_done. In case it is a  \npositive value, new_lockspace would undo all the work, and lockspace  \nwould not be set. __dlm_new_lockspace, however, would treat that  \npositive value as a success due to commit 8511a2728ab8 (\"dlm: fix use  \ncount with multiple joins\").\n\nDown the line, device_create_lockspace would pass that NULL lockspace to  \ndlm_find_lockspace_local, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nTreating such positive values as successes prevents the problem. Given  \nthis has been broken for so long, this is unlikely to break userspace  \nexpectations.\nSeverity: 0.0 | NA\nVisit the link for more details, such as CVSS details, affected products, timeline, and more...","Detection Date":"16 Apr 2025","Type":"Vulnerability"}
