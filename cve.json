      "severity": "0.0 | NA",
      "type": "Vulnerability",
      "description": "In the Linux kernel, a vulnerability was resolved in the function do_uevent which returned a positive value to event_done. This caused new_lockspace to undo operations and leave lockspace unset. Due to commit 8511a2728ab8, __dlm_new_lockspace treated it as success. Later, device_create_lockspace passed NULL to dlm_find_lockspace_local, resulting in a null pointer dereference (NPD). Fixing the return handling prevents the crash without breaking userspace behavior.",
